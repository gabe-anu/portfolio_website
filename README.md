## Notes

**070425:** This is my portfolio website I made as a personal project for myself. Had a lot of fun with this project especially the CSS which allowed me to better play around with design concepts and styles. I'm proud of myself for finding ways to implement icons as links for the nav bar and the pixel text font. I'm excited to revist this website later to iterate on it later with JavaScript and React 

Time spent: **48** hours spent in total
